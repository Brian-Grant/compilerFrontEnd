Source to Source translation from a simple language called let-tl0, which allows
a language feature called let statements to a language called vanilla-tl0 
which does not allow these let statements. All let statements are transformed 
into an allowable and equivalent form in vanilla-tl0

Everything is working. There are 6 let.tl0 files and the 
resulting 6 let-xform.tl0 files.
